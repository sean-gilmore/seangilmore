      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rails Ajax form submission is a topic that is widely covered, but I&amp;rsquo;m yet to find a resource that deals with how to set up a completely custom implementation, from form submission to controller action, through to returning some response via Javascript and updating the page view dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was learning about ajax form submission, I put together this document to help myself in the future. The problem I was working on at the time was to create a &amp;lsquo;hand raisers&amp;rsquo; form that would submit and update with a response from the server if the submission had been successful, or if it had issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you too can get some use from it.&lt;/p&gt;
