I'd like to think I'm at least somewhat environmentally conscious. I try to take public transport where possible, avoid single use plastics and I spend a good amount of time worrying if I'm recycling correctly.
I care about the environment and hope that we are able to maintain our world for ourselves and future generations to enjoy.

Thinking about environmental protection from the standpoint of a technical problem to be solved is kind of empowering. It's nice to think that looking after our planet is within the grasp of everyone, and that I might be able to do my part to help swing the tide back towards it's protection.
