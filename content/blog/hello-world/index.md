Hello World! This is the first blog on my new website.

This site it built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) the static site generator, using a modified version of the [Tale](https://github.com/EmielH/tale-hugo) theme.

I chose to make this site using a static site generator based on a couple of factors:

- I've used Hugo before and am fairly familiar with the syntax
- Static sites are fast, and hosting them is very cheap
- I recently learnt of [Forestry](https://forestry.io/), a web interface for content management for static sites (limited to Hugo, Jekyll and VuePress for the time being) and wanted to see how it worked.

Overall it's made for a good holiday project with a quick, effective result.
