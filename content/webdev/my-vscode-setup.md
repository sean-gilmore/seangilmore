Visual Studio Code, the text editor and quasi-IDE built by Microsoft has been my favourite editor for the past two years. Out of the box it comes with tones of great features like IntelliSense, an integrated terminal and git tooling. I've been using vscode as my editor of choice for two years, falling it in love with it over my current editor at the time - atom. While both editors are built on top of [electron](), vscode at the time offered far superior performance, which was enough of a reason for me to jump ship.

Vscode, just like most editors these days, brings along an extension marketplace (even though I've never paid for an extension in my life). These extension bring all sorts of useful functionality, from better syntax highlighting, through to code bookmarking. In my two years of use I've tried a lot of extensions, and I think I've found a good combination that works for me.
