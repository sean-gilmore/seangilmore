For a while now I've spent a fair bit of time thinking about (and writing) CSS. Writing CSS is one of those tasks I love - getting that instant visual feedback and knowing that you've managed to put together a website that is now not only functional but also beautiful and engaging. It's also fun from the standpoint of taking someones design and being the one to bring it to life - like putting together lego 🏠 or an Ikea cabinet 🔨. But there is one issue with writing and working with CSS - worrying about how your CSS is going to be maintained over time.
