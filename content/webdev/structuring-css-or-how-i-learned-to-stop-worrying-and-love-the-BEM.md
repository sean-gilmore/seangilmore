For a while now I've spent a fair bit of time thinking about (and writing) CSS. Writing CSS is one of those tasks I love - getting that instant visual feedback and knowing that you've managed to put together a website that is now not only functional but also beautiful and engaging. It's also fun from the standpoint of taking someones design and being the one to bring it to life - like putting together lego 🏠 or an Ikea cabinet 🔨. But there is one issue with writing and working with CSS - worrying about how your CSS is going to be maintained over time.

This problem gets even harder when you start throwing scss into the mix (yes, scss can make things worse in some ways) and you have multiple developers all with different ideas about how styles should organised, and trying to change and add styles without breaking things unknowingly. In a long running project all of these factors can add up and produce some nasty, hard to unwind tangles of very fragile styles that no one wants to touch.
