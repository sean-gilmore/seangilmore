Currently working as a web developer for [Arcadian Digital](//arcadiandigital.com.au/) in Melbourne, Australia.

I love the web, and everything to do with computers, and I have a real interest for finding new and interesting ways to get stuff done, better and faster.

Since seriously getting into programming in 2013 it has become a real passion of mine. I enjoy learning new frameworks and design patterns and I'm always looking for ways to make the code I write better.
